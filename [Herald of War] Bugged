Herald of War: http://www.wowhead.com/quest=13257/herald-of-war

This quest is bugged from what I can see, I got the quest from Saurfang in Borrean Tundra and he said to take a portal,
there was no portal anywhere in sight, so I used my Hearthstone and went back to Orgrimmar. I went to Thrall, and Thrall simply
doesn't allow you to complete the quest, because the question mark doesn't appear above his head, or anything, it's simply bugged
you can talk to him but a pop up of a quest appeared for me, that's all, it's a low quest probably for like 10-20, I'm level 72.
